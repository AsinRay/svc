这个demo向您展示了如何写一个svchost启动的windows 服务，在OS启动时
它会一起启动，svchost会检查注册表中的分组，此服务使用了netsvcs组，
并使用LocalSystem用用户来启动这个服务(为了安全期间，这也是MS推荐的做法)。
Our DLL exports three functions:
ServiceMain()
InstallService() and RemoveService(). The final two are instal and remove
the service by RunDll32 using command line.
Note that the command prompt it launched in administrator mode.You can 
put the isvc.dll file in the System32 folder and then to install the 
service, type the following line:
rundll32 isvc.dll InstallService

To remove the service you type:
rundll32 isvc.dll RemoveSerivce

If you choose a location other than System32 it will type the full path of the dll.
The installation or removal of our service n? BLINDNESS a red? Windows startup. 
All of? Details of the installation and configuration of our service are included 
in the code InstallService () function. 
Our service uses a timer to write, every minute, in a log file 
c:\windows\isvc.log, date and time to trigger the timer?. This is just to show 
the functioning of the service. For all d? Details, look at the source code. 
code is r? alis? in C with Visual C / C + + 2010, but it is easily adaptable to 
other tools. 
To pr? server the clarity? code, error handling is minimal. 
Has the department t? test? no problem? me under Windows XP, Vista and 7. 
RacppService.dll The dll is provided in the zip if you liked to test. 
Voil?, I esp? re having nothing forgotten?.
